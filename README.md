CURRENT TODO:
- add all cards to all sections in intervals as to not overwhelm the ai. can use deepseek for this (claude has RATE LIMITED MY ASS)
- Add audio to each card. Include several voice options for max perspective. 
- I want to toy with mnemonics, perhaps by flipping the cards over to reveal an image in realtion to the symbol in question. 
- Brainstorm a Cultrual Immersion section. Think like a megathread for modern Chinese culture that leads to immersion and feedback, and include resources used for the website.
- add concise summaries for each component of chinese within their respective sections.
- add an index section that covers all terms used when learning chinese/mandarin
