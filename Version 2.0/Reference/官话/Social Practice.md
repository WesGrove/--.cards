> Goal: 5-minute read, zero jargon.

---

## 1. Daily Greetings
- **Handshake** is common in business; **light nod** suffices among friends.  
- Address people by **title + surname** (e.g., “Manager Li”).  
- Avoid first names unless invited.

---

## 2. Gift-Giving
- **Never give clocks** (sounds like “attending a funeral”).  
- Present and receive with **both hands**.  
- Gifts are **refused once or twice before accepted**—keep insisting politely.

---

## 3. Dining Etiquette
- Host orders; **guests wait to be seated**.  
- **Don’t stick chopsticks upright** in rice (funeral symbol).  
- **Toasting**: clink your cup **lower** than elders’ to show respect.

---

## 4. Digital Norms
- **WeChat** is the default wallet + ID.  
- Red envelopes (hongbao) sent via app for birthdays, weddings, holidays.  
- **Voice messages** are normal; typing long texts can seem cold.

---

## 5. Face & Harmony
- **“Face” (面子 miànzi)** = social dignity.  
- Criticize **privately** and **indirectly**.  
- Public arguments are avoided; silence often means disagreement.

---

## 6. Work Culture Snapshot
- **996** (9 am–9 pm, 6 days) is fading; **“5-day week”** pushed by new laws.  
- **WeChat Work** groups run 24/7—mute after hours unless urgent.  
- Promotions favor **seniority + guanxi (relationships)**.

---

## 7. Green & Health Trends
- **“Naked” weddings** = no dowry, no banquet, minimal waste.  
- **Bring-your-own-cup** is cool; plastic straws draw stares.  
- **Fitness apps** like Keep sync with WeChat steps—daily 10 k goal.

## Quick Do & Don’t
