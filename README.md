Flash cards for written Chinese that cover the HSK1 through HSK6 grammar levels, built using Claude AI and organized by:
- Rules/Index
- Tones
- Pinyin
- Structure
- Strokes
- Radicals
- Hanzi
CURRENT TODO:
- Clean Up Overview Tables in Basics (adding all radicals, changing styling a bit) and Add Overview sections for each HSK1 through HSK6
- Add Cards for Basics sections that cover the rules/index, Tones, Pinyin, Structure, Strokes, and Radicals.
- Add audio to each card. I'm not sure how this would work yet, but I like the idea of having several options for max perpective.
- I want to toy with mnemonics, perhaps by flipping the cards over to reveal an image in realtion to the symbol in question. 
- Add shiny and hover effects for cards to make them more card like. I want to scratch the commoditiy itch. 
- Add Cards for HSK2 through HSK6
- Brainstorm a Cultrual Immersion section. Think like a megathread for modern Chinese culture that leads to immersion and feedback, and include resources used for the website.
- Find a way to split the long ass HTML i got so far into seperate HTMLs and CSSs into several by section so the project doesnt get bloated in one place.
