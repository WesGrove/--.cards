## 1. Know Your Learner

- Who is the site for (age, level, goal)?
    
- What device will they mostly use (phone vs. desktop)?
    
- How much time do they have per visit?
    

## 2. Pick & Order the Content

- Choose ONE target language first.
    
- List the 20 most common real-life topics (ordering food, small talk, etc.).
    
- Break each topic into 3–5 micro-lessons (max 5 min each).
    

## 3. Keep the Interface Simple

- One screen = one action (listen, speak, quiz).
    
- Big buttons, high-contrast colors, and a clear “Next” arrow.
    
- Show progress with a small progress bar, not complex dashboards.
    

## 4. Make Interactions Feel Human

- Record short native-speaker audio (not robotic TTS).
    
- Let learners record themselves and play it back instantly.
    
- Add quick emoji feedback (👍/👎) instead of long comments.
    

## 5. Make It Work Offline

- Cache the last 3 lessons automatically.
    
- Show a tiny “offline mode” badge so users know it still works.
    

## 6. Track Only What Matters

- Store: words seen, words spoken correctly, streak days.
    
- Skip: detailed grammar scores, social leaderboards.
