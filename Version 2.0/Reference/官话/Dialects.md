# Mandarin Dialects – Simple Overview

| Region        | Common Name                | Key Features                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **North**     | Beijing Mandarin           | “r”-added sounds (儿化音), neutral tones                    |
| **Northeast** | Northeastern (Dongbei)     | Strong retroflex, “er” endings, lively intonation        |
| **East**      | Shanghainese Wu-influenced | Soft retroflex, merges “sh” / “s”, rising tones glide    |
| **Central**   | Southwestern (Sichuan)     | Few retroflex, wide tone range, “n” ↔ “l” mixing         |
| **South**     | Yue & Min-influenced       | Entering-tone remnants, consonant endings, sharper tones |

### Quick Notes
- **Mutual Intelligibility**: Mostly high among northern dialects; drops toward south.
- **Standard Reference**: Putonghua is based on Beijing pronunciation + northern grammar.
- **Phonetic Shifts**: Retroflex series (zh, ch, sh) often weaken to alveolar (z, c, s) in the south.
- **Tone Count**: 4 in the north, up to 7-8 in some southern pockets.

> Tip: If you learn Putonghua, you’ll be understood almost everywhere; local color comes from these regional flavors.
