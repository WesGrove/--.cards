CURRENT TODO:
- Redo Obsidian language vault to be more context oriented so that AI can properly pull information the way I need.
- Look in to claude code for VSCode integration for greater project architecture


OLD TODO:
- add all cards to all sections in intervals as to not overwhelm the ai. can use deepseek for this (claude has RATE LIMITED MY ASS)
- Add audio to each card. Include several voice options for max perspective. 
- put each main character from each flashcard in a window the way the first draft is done, but make it to where when you click the window it fades to the corrosponding mnemonic so you can click back and forth between the character and what it looks like based on its meaning. for example, éª¨ being the bone radical fading to a picture of a little skeleton. 
- Brainstorm a Cultrual Immersion section. Think like a megathread for modern Chinese culture that leads to immersion and feedback, and include resources used for the website.
- add concise summaries for each component of chinese within their respective sections.
- add an index section that covers all terms used when learning chinese/mandarin
