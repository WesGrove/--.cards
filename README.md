# DISCLAIMER

This has been made with AI. I am not a professional in any way, I'm just a hobbiest with access to some good AI. That being said, this building style is very broken down and simplified, so at the least if it's not accurate, one could use it as a guideline for making an accurate one. If there are any linguistic experts out there, please let me know how I can improve this.
